#Swiveler
Ongoing project that started as a final project for my Game Programming course in Spring 2015
at UMD. Swiveler is a 2D puzzle-platforming game that tasks the player with rotating pieces of
map in order to reach the end goal. This game uses standard assets from the Unity Assets Store.
The game was developed using Unity 5.0 and scripts are written in C#.
