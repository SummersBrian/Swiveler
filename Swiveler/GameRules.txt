Swiveler Puzzle Rules (can tweak based on development needs):
1. Player can rotate designated squares
2. Squares of the same designation/color rotate simultaneously
3. Cocentric or contained squares
	a. Outer (parent) squares affect inner (child) squares - rotation of a parent will rotate itself and all children about the parent's center. This results in no change of the squares relative to each other, but a rotation change of all the squares relative to the player.
	b. Child squares do not affect their parent, only their own children.
4. Player can rotate squares mid motion. This enables some timing and skill based jumps to solve puzzles, so there is no need to lock a configuration to solve a puzzle
5. Player can slide platforms that are designated sliders (ie. platforms that have the "slide mechanism" attached).
6. Player can slide platforms only:
	a. When they are grounded. The player cannot slide platforms mid jumping
	b. When two adjacent slide mechanisms are touching (this allows for transfer of the platform between squares)
	c. When the player is not standing on the platform they wish to slide.
